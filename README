This application implements a precinct lookup from Google VIP information, based on the version 1.5 of the spec.  It is capable of importing VIP data through a rake task, and will then display polling location information on a Google Map using the ym4r/gm plugin.  

Future work:
 - Separate app in to a presentation front-end and a plugin-based back-end handling VIP info
 - ignore bad tags, according to spec
 - external links
 - ballot candidate order import
